Introduction to LEMs
====================
This chapter's purpose is to familiarize the user with what local energy markets (LEMs) actually are, how they work,
who the participants are and basic terminology used in this research area.

Definition of LEMs
------------------
Give a definition of LEMs.

`Inspiration`_:
The overall goal of the electricity market is to provide electricity in an efficient way while meeting the demands of
the consumers. The competition and regulations are the different way to achieve this goal. The traditional electricity
market is facing challenges in integrating the new sources of generation of electricity, technology, infrastructure,
increasing demand and the consumer-oriented market. It has shifted the paradigm towards new market design which will be
able to fit in existing market structure. One of such electricity market is local electricity market. The benefits of
local power generation, storage and demand response all cooperate together and peer-to-peer model enables the
participation of all participants of the market. It uses information and communication technology (ICT) for sustainable
and efficiently transfer of electricity to the consumers. It integrates the distributed generation, microgrid, and
smart grid into one electricity market at distribution side.
